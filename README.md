Welcome to the official repository for the paper **"Linking with Bias: Domain-Specific Behaviour in Entity Linking Systems"**. This project investigates the **systemic domain bias** present in modern **entity linking (EL)** systems and introduces benchmark resources to measure and potentially mitigate such biases.

## 🧠 Summary

Entity linking systems are widely adopted in knowledge-driven NLP applications, but they are often trained and evaluated on narrow, homogeneous domains. Our work reveals how these systems perform inconsistently across different domains, exposing a **domain bias** that hinders fairness and generalizability.

We contribute:

- **📊 A comprehensive analysis** of domain bias in EL systems.
- **🧾 DOMiNO**, a new benchmark dataset *balanced across 37 domains*.
- **🗂️ DOMeX**, a resource linking existing EL datasets to explicit domain labels.
- **🧪 Novel dataset variants** (ACE2004N, AIDAN, etc.) with novel mentions (and anonymized triples) to isolate bias factors.
- **📦 All datasets provided in NIF format** for interoperability and benchmarking.
- **🧪 Dataset preparation and evaluation scripts**

## 📦 Datasets

All datasets are released under open-access licenses (when possible) and available on Zenodo in NIF (NLP Interchange Format). Use these datasets to replicate, extend, or benchmark your own entity linking systems.
### 🧬 DOMiNO: Domain-Balanced EL Benchmark

A novel dataset containing documents balanced across 37 domains, with and without nif:topic annotations to enable domain-specific evaluation.

    📁 Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/15620484

    🔍 Includes: domain lookup, bias evaluation-ready annotations

    📄 Format: RDF/NIF
	


### 🗂️ DOMeX: Domain Metadata for EL Datasets

Provides domain mappings for several existing entity linking datasets to support bias analysis.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Download the datasets from Zenodo and place them in the defined directory as defined in constants.py

Then you may run the notebooks to reproduce our analyses.


## 📈 Evaluation Framework

Use our pipeline to:

    * Measure and visualize domain bias
    * Interface with existing EL models
    * Run cross-domain, domain-specific or domain-limited evaluations
